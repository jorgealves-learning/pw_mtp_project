## 📌 Scope

This documentation covers the essential GitHub collaboration tools that help teams work efficiently and deliver high-quality projects:

- **Issues**: Learn how to create and manage tasks using issues. We’ll show you how to label, assign, and prioritize work items, and track progress using milestones. Issues help teams keep track of bugs, feature requests, or any other actionable tasks.  
- **Discussions**: Use GitHub Discussions to foster open communication, brainstorm ideas, and resolve questions collaboratively beyond just code. This tool promotes community engagement and helps teams capture valuable input from all members.  
- **Pull Requests**: Understand how to review and collaborate on code changes with pull requests. You will learn how to provide constructive feedback by adding comments, requesting changes, and approving contributions. Pull requests ensure that every change is reviewed for quality before merging into the main project branch.  
- **Wiki**: Create and maintain detailed project documentation in the GitHub Wiki so your team has a central, easy-to-access knowledge base. This helps reduce onboarding time and keeps everyone aligned with project goals, guidelines, and workflows.  
- **Project Boards**: Visualize your workflow using Kanban, Scrum, or custom project boards to organize tasks, track progress, and maintain focus on priorities. Project boards give teams a clear view of what’s in progress, what’s done, and what’s next, helping to manage workload effectively.

The guide emphasizes practical usage, with real-world examples and step-by-step instructions to help teams of any size or industry adopt GitHub collaboration tools without needing to write code or perform technical tasks.
