## **What is Branch Naming?**
Branch naming is a methodological convention , not a Git requirement, that acts as the first line of documentation for your standalone work.

The fundamental concept is that a branch name should immediately answer two questions: What (the type of work) and Why (the context or task).

## **What are Workflow Patterns?**
Workflow Patterns, or Branching Strategies , are the set of methodological rules and conventions that a team adopts to manage software development using Git (the terminal tool) and GitHub (the collaboration platform).

These aren't new Git commands; it's about how and when your team uses commands like git branch`git pull` git mergeor `git git pushgit add`. The main goal is to standardize collaboration so everyone is on the same page when adding a feature or fixing a bug .
