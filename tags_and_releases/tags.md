A tag is a permanent marker for a specific commit. It's like placing a "milestone" or a "bookmark" at an exact point in your project's history.

The Why: You use a tag to identify points in the history that are important and that you want to be easy to find forever.

The crucial difference between a branch and a tag is:

A branch is a pointer that moves every time you make a new commit.

A tag is a pointer that is fixed. It points to one commit and never moves again.

When to Use Tags?
The most important and almost universal use case for tags is marking release versions (releases).

Tags are the backbone of any versioning strategy and are the technical prerequisite for creating Releases on platforms like GitHub or GitLab.
