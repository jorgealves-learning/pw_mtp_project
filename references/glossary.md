# 📚 Glossary – Collaboration Concepts on GitHub

## 🤝 Collaboration
**Definition:**  
The process of working together with other developers or contributors on a shared GitHub repository.  
Collaboration involves sharing code, reviewing changes, discussing improvements, and maintaining project quality collectively.

**Key Tools:**  
- Branches and commits  
- Pull requests and code reviews  
- Issues, discussions, and Wikis  
- Project boards and milestones

## 🗣️ Issues and Discussions
**Issues:**  
A GitHub feature used to **track tasks, bugs, feature requests, or improvements**.  
Each issue can have labels, assignees, and milestones to organize development work.

**Discussions:**  
A space for **open-ended conversations** related to the project. Unlike issues, discussions are not tied to a specific task — they are used for brainstorming, feedback, and community engagement.

**Best Practices:**  
- Use clear titles and tags for issues.  
- Convert discussions into issues when they evolve into actionable tasks.  
- Close issues once they’re resolved and reference them in commits or pull requests.

## 🔄 Pull Requests and Reviews
**Pull Request (PR):**  
A proposal to merge code changes from one branch into another (usually into the main branch).  
PRs allow contributors to suggest updates and enable maintainers to review and discuss changes before integration.

**Code Review:**  
The process of **examining code in a pull request** to ensure quality, maintainability, and consistency.  
Reviewers can comment on lines of code, request changes, or approve the merge.

**Best Practices:**  
- Write descriptive PR titles and summaries.  
- Keep PRs small and focused.  
- Review code constructively and check for style, logic, and performance issues.

## 📘 Wiki and Documentation
**Wiki:**  
A collaborative space in GitHub where teams can create and edit project documentation.  
Wikis are Git repositories themselves, allowing version control and contribution through Markdown files.

**Documentation:**  
Written resources that explain how to install, configure, and use a project.  
It may include technical details, API references, tutorials, and FAQs.

**Best Practices:**  
- Keep documentation up to date with the codebase.  
- Use clear structure and consistent formatting.  
- Link the Wiki from the main README for visibility.

## 📅 Project Management
**Definition:**  
The organization and tracking of development work using GitHub’s built-in tools, such as **Projects**, **Milestones**, and **Labels**.

**GitHub Projects:**  
A Kanban-style board used to visualize and manage tasks, linking issues and pull requests to stages like *To Do*, *In Progress*, and *Done*.

**Milestones:**  
Used to group related issues and pull requests under a common goal, such as a release or sprint.

**Labels:**  
Tags that help categorize and prioritize issues (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`).

**Best Practices:**  
- Use project boards to plan and track progress.  
- Assign milestones for release cycles.  
- Apply consistent labeling to improve workflow visibility.
