1. Introduction

Writing commit messages that clearly and concisely describe changes can be very challenging.

In this tutorial, we will study some of the best practices for Git commit messages.

First, we will understand the concept of commit messages and their relevance. Next, we will examine best practices for creating well-structured and informative commit messages. Then, we will see how to create well-structured commit messages through the command line. Finally, we will summarize the best practices.

2.1. What is a commit message?

When working in a Git repository, we make changes to the source code and save them all the time. In this context, we refer to each saved change as a commit.

3.1. Structure for Good Commit Messages

A simple commit message is usually composed of a single sentence. However, it is very common for a single sentence not to be able to provide enough information about the context of the commit.

A widely adopted approach to providing more context is the use of structured commit messages. This type of message is made up of three parts:

<Subject>

<Description>

<Tags and External References>

Subject

The first line briefly describes the commit and serves as its title. It should be clear and concise.

Description

The description provides more detailed information about the changes made. It commonly requires more than one sentence.

Tags and External References

Tags indicate the type of change (feature, bug fix, etc.), while external references (such as ticket numbers) specify which issue is being addressed.

3.2. How to Elaborate the Content of the Message

Beyond using a well-defined structure, it's important to know what to say and how to use the message. This involves knowing some basic principles for writing the subject and description.

Imperative Mood

The most essential principle for writing the subject is the use of the imperative mood:

Instead of: “Adding…”, “Fixing…”, “Reverting…”

Use: “Add…”, “Fix…”, “Revert…”

Emphasize the “Why”

A better subject explains purpose, not just action:

Weak: “Add import_key() function”

Strong: “Add support for users to import keys”

Example Description:

Currently, users can only use keys created within the platform.
Adds the import_key() function to allow the import of keys created externally.

3.3. The 50/72 Rule

The 50/72 rule is a widely adopted standard for commit message formatting.

50 characters → maximum length of the subject

72 characters → maximum width of each line in the body

These limits follow conventions seen in major projects (e.g., the Linux kernel) and readability guidelines.

3.4. Conventional Commits

The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention that adds human- and machine-readable meaning to commit messages, enabling automation.

Common Commit Types
Type	Description
feat	Introduce a new feature
fix	Fix a bug
docs	Create/update documentation
style	Styling updates
refactor	Refactor code
test	Add/update tests
chore	Maintenance tasks
Subject Format
<type>(optional scope): <subject-description>


Example:

feat(api): Add support to create coupons

Breaking Changes

You can indicate breaking changes using:

BREAKING CHANGE:


or adding ! after the type:

chore!: Update Python version to use newer libs

5. Summary

To achieve great Git commit messages:

Create a subject and a description (separated by one blank line)

Specify the commit type (feat, fix, style, etc.)

Use the imperative mood in the subject

Explain in the description what changed and why

Keep the subject under 50 characters

Format the description in 72-character columns

5. Conclusion

In this tutorial, we’ve studied the main best practices for writing good Git commit messages. Many common practices—such as the 50/72 rule and conventional commits—help us write well-structured and informative messages.
