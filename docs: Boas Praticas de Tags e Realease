Usage of Tags and Releases in Version Control
In software development, it is essential to maintain an organized history of the changes made to the code. For this purpose, version control tools, such as Git, offer features that help record and identify important milestones in a project's lifecycle. Among these features, tags and releases stand out, being widely used for software versioning and distribution.

TAG:
Tags are markers used to identify specific points in a repository's commit history. In practice, they function as "labels" that record the exact state of the code at a given moment, usually when the project reaches a stable version.

For example, upon finishing the development of a system's first version, a tag named v1.0.0 can be created. This way, even if the code continues to evolve, it is easy to go back to this version in the future.

Tags usually follow Semantic Versioning, a widely adopted standard that organizes versions in the format MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, where:
MAJOR: indicates significant changes that are incompatible with previous versions.
MINOR: represents new features that are compatible with previous versions.
PATCH: corresponds to error fixes or small improvements.

For example:
v1.0.0 = (1).0.0 = MAJOR = first stable version. Represents the first stable, production-ready release (baseline);
v1.1.0 = 1.(1).0 = MINOR = adds a new feature, but nothing that already worked has changed;
v1.1.1 = 1.1.(1) = PATCH = fixes a bug without altering existing functionality. It means only the error was corrected, without adding anything new or making changes.

RELEASE
While tags mark versions within the code, releases represent the act of officially publishing these versions. They are typically created from a tag and include a detailed summary of the changes made, such as new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements.

On code hosting platforms like GitHub or GitLab, releases can also include binary files, installation packages, or other artifacts generated by the project, making it easier to distribute the software to end-users or deployment teams.

A good practice is to always include a clear and organized summary of the changes in the release notes, highlighting:

New Features: newly added functionalities.

Fixes: solved problems.

Improvements: internal adjustments and optimizations.

Breaking Changes: alterations that require special attention.

Importance and Best Practices:
The proper use of tags and releases brings several benefits to software development:

Facilitates version organization and tracking;

Allows for quickly reverting to a stable state of the project;

Improves communication between developers and users;

Ensures transparency and clear documentation about system evolution.

Some best practices include:

Creating tags only for stable and tested versions;

Maintaining consistency in the versioning standard;

Never reusing old tags — always create new ones;

Associating each release with an existing tag;

Automating the tag and release creation process through CI/CD pipelines, when possible.

Conclusion
In summary, tags and releases are essential elements for version control and software management. While tags identify specific versions of the source code, releases make these versions official and documented. Using both resources correctly contributes to the organization, traceability, and quality of development, in addition to facilitating teamwork and software distribution.
