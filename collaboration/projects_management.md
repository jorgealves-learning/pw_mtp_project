# 🗂️ GitHub Project Boards

GitHub **Project Boards** are tools that help you organize and track your work directly within GitHub.  
They provide a visual overview of your project’s workflow — similar to Kanban boards — and integrate tightly with **issues** and **pull requests**.

---

## 📘 What Are Project Boards?

A **Project Board** is a customizable board that lets you manage tasks, features, and bugs in a visual way.  
You can use it to plan sprints, manage releases, or track development progress.

Each project board is made up of:

- **Columns** – Represent stages of work (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).  
- **Cards** – Represent issues, pull requests, or notes.  
- **Automation** – Automatically move cards based on issue or PR status.

## 🧩 Types of GitHub Project Boards

GitHub offers **two types** of project boards:

| Type | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Classic Projects** | The original Kanban-style boards with columns for “To Do,” “In Progress,” and “Done.” |
| **Projects (Beta)** | The new version with a spreadsheet-like view. You can add custom fields, filters, and automation for advanced project tracking. |

## 🧠 Example Workflow

A common use case for GitHub Project Boards follows this flow:

### 1. Create an Issue
Start by opening an issue for a new task or feature.  
Example:  
> “Add user authentication system”

### 2. Add the Issue to a Project Board
Assign the issue to your board’s **To Do** column.


### 3. Start Working
When development begins, move the issue card to the **In Progress** column.

### 4. Open a Pull Request
Link your pull request to the issue.  
GitHub automatically keeps the board updated as the PR moves through reviews.

### 5. Merge and Close
When the PR is merged and the issue is closed, the card is automatically moved to **Done**.

### ✅ Result
You get a real-time, visual overview of your project’s progress — from idea to completion.
