# 🗂️ GitHub Project Boards

GitHub **Project Boards** are tools that help you organize and track your work directly within GitHub.  
They provide a visual overview of your project’s workflow — similar to Kanban boards — and integrate tightly with **issues** and **pull requests**.

## 📘 What Are Project Boards?

A **Project Board** is a customizable board that lets you manage tasks, features, and bugs in a visual way.  
You can use it to plan sprints, manage releases, or track development progress.

Each project board is made up of:

- **Columns** – Represent stages of work (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).  
- **Cards** – Represent issues, pull requests, or notes.  
- **Automation** – Automatically move cards based on issue or PR status.

## 🧩 Types of GitHub Project Boards

GitHub offers **two types** of project boards:

| Type | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Classic Projects** | The original Kanban-style boards with columns for “To Do,” “In Progress,” and “Done.” |
| **Projects (Beta)** | The new version with a spreadsheet-like view. You can add custom fields, filters, and automation for advanced project tracking. |
