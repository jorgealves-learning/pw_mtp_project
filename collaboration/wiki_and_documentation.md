# 🧾 GitHub Wikis

## 📘 Introduction
**GitHub Wikis** are a built-in feature of the GitHub platform that allow teams to create and manage collaborative documentation for software projects.  
Each repository can have its own Wiki, serving as a dedicated space for explaining, organizing, and sharing information about the project.

The main goal is to **facilitate communication and collaboration** among developers, teams, and users by keeping documentation close to the source code.

## ⚙️ Key Features

### 🧩 Git-Based Structure
Each Wiki is a **separate Git repository**, which means you can:
- Clone, edit, and update it locally;
- Keep a complete commit history;
- Use branches and version control just like any other repository.

### 📝 Markdown Support
Wiki pages are written in **Markdown**, allowing you to:
- Create headings, lists, tables, and links easily;
- Add **formatted code blocks**;
- Include **images and diagrams**;
- Create **internal links** between Wiki pages.

### 🗂️ Organization and Navigation
- Pages can be linked to form a **hierarchical structure**;
- A **Home** page serves as the main entry point;
- You can create **indexes, sections, and guides** to organize your documentation.
