# Basics of Branch Naming
Some basic rules to imply when someone wants to give a name to a branch should be, the name the branch only have lowercases, use underscores and hyphens instead of spaces and avoiding using special characters.

Use a prefix to categorize the branch: Start the name with a word indicating its purpose. Examples include:
 - feature/ for new features
 - bugfix/ for bug fixes
 - hotfix/ for urgent, critical fixes
 - release/ for release-related branches
 - chore/ for maintenance tasks
 - experiment/ for trying out new ideas

**Short but useful descriptions** are ideal, keeping the same rules as the branches names.
