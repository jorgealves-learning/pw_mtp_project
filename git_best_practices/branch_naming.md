## **Basics of Branch Naming**
Some basic rules to imply when someone wants to give a name to a branch should be, the name the branch only have lowercases, use underscores and hyphens instead of spaces and avoiding using special characters.

## **Prefix**
Start the name with a word indicating its purpose. Some examples ahead.
 - **feature/** for new features
 - **bugfix/** for bug fixes
 - **hotfix/** for urgent, critical fixes
 - **release/** for release-related branches
 - **chore/** for maintenance tasks
 - **experiment/** for trying out new ideas
 - **docs/** for text documents


**Short but useful descriptions** are ideal, keeping the same rules as the branches names for reading more easily.
